Contributing 
------------

Contributions are encouraged and welcomed! Please keep in mind the following guidelines:

- Keep styling minimal with lots of whitespace and few fonts/colors
- No external resources. Use vanilla javascript, and encode images/sounds using data URI/base64
- The utilities have minimal features for a purpose. We want to keep Smartmarks speedy, so don't go overboard on features.
